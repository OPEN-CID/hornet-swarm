## What I do

- scope sheet
- deliverable list
- open questions

## When to use me

Use when:

- starting from a client brief

Don't use when:

- The request is outside this skill's job. Say so and point to the right skill if you know it.
- You lack the source material this task needs. Ask for it first instead of guessing.

## Workflow

1. Collect: ask the user to paste text or attach the file/image; if only part is available, work with that part and say so.
2. Extract: pull every required field into a table (Field | Value quoted | Source location). Mark illegible or missing fields as UNKNOWN, never guess.
3. Normalize: convert units, dates, and names to one consistent format; keep the original value beside each conversion.
4. Cross-check: flag conflicts between sections (totals vs line items, dates vs versions); list each conflict with both quotes.
5. Deliver: produce the artifact below plus a trace table so anyone can verify each value in seconds.

## Rules / Constraints

MUST: quote exact source values; mark UNKNOWN instead of guessing.
MUST: keep a source-to-field trace so every value is verifiable.
MUST NOT: invent missing pages, values, or signatures.

## Output format

``text
## Production sheet: scope, deliverables, task list, dates, owner
- Sources checked: <what you read>
- Confidence: <high/medium/low + what would raise it>
``

## References

- No extra files by default. If the task grows complex, split it: parse first, then review, then act.
